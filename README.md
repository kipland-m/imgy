# imgy - command line image resizing tool

imgy is my C-based command line tool to provide a simple, effective way to resize images through the command line. This is a tool with developers in mind.Â 

### Features to implement!
Here's what is currently on my plate to add/fix/improve on within *imgy*

- [ ] Create first 'release' for first working version and begin adding new features using branching
- [ ] Once an official build/release is made, work on uploading to apt-get
- [ ] Improve command line interaction (allow user to input size, optional flags)
- [ ] Clean up comment walls of text
- [ ] Implement feature to allow users to keep aspect ratio (i.e. only giving one dimension)
- [ ] Start brainstorming on adding support for PNGs
- [ ] Start brainstorming on adding additional resizing algorithms (allow users to select which is used via flags)

## Example usage (as of now):
- Compiling

We could add some flags in there:

	> imgy /pics/CuteBinky.jpg 400x400 -o BinkyResized.jpg
	Made a resized copy of CuteBinky.jpg at /pics/BinkyResized.jpg
	
	> imgy /pics/CuteBinky.jpg 400x400 -c
	Made a resized copy of CuteBinky.jpg (CuteBinky1.jpg)  
  
How will we be doing the resizing?

Initially we will be testing using only jpegs, but safe to assume for now that pngs will follow a similar process

To resize the image, we are doing a bunch of black magic C stuff that I intend to understand more as this project progresses.

First, we will be creating a struct with *jpeg_decompress_struct* hold things related to the image such as a pointer to the actual file, header data about the dimensions of the image, and some error configuration so we can properly resolve issues related to processing the image.

Then, we will begin decompressing the image and reading the pixel lines of the image. Now, with access to pixel data, we will be able to load it up in a buffer then which we can start doing some resizing magic from.

## The big picture
Really, our program revolves around a few things:
- The decompression struct provided by libjpeg
- Our big ole buffer (stores all of our pixel data!)
- An algorithm to manipulate this buffer of pixel data into our new image (a.k.a. re-sizing)

We are creating a few structs with libjpeg, and loading them up with metadata. We provide our decompression struct with a pointer to our open file.

We then read details about the image like its header data, to understand things like the dimensions of the image.

Then, we start the decompression process.

We create a variable that represents the length of a row of pixels in our image 

We create a buffer that will be capable of holding all the pixels in our image. This is calculated by the length times the height times the components (components = 3 for RGB).

## High-level code overview

How should we build this project? Well, it's C. So, thank god, that we don't have to deal with stupid OOP principles. We are going to have a couple files that have a variety of functions that we will try our best to have clear, defined purposes. So what will these functions look like?

* `int main(int main(int argc, char \*argv[])`

	this is our main function. it will handle taking our command line arguments. we can expect to handle our input errors here, and handle supplying all the functions that actually make up our program their necessary data.

	Currently it calls:
	- read_jpeg()

- `int read_jpeg(char \*infile, char \*\*outfile)`

	This a sort of *main* function for getting our jpeg data. This will handle the definition and initialization of our `decomp` struct. It will pass this struct to our `do_read_jpeg` which just feels like a total badass function name out of the like 90s or something.

- `int do_read_jpeg(struct jpeg_decompress_struct decomp, char \*infilepath, char \*outfilepath)`

	This is where the real meat and taters is of our progress so far. This handles setting up our error struct, actually opening the image provided and reading the header data, pixel data, etc.	

- `void resize_jpeg(struct jpeg_decompress_struct decomp, unsigned char \*input_buffer, char \*outfilepath)`

	We can expect to either call this from do_read_jpeg, or, somehow handle passing the buffer to it so then it can manipulate and resize it in that function. This function will contain our crazy nearest neighbor algorithm for resizing.
	
- `int save_jpeg(unsigned char \*resize_buffer, JSAMPARRAY row_pointers, char \*outfilepath, float resize_width, float resize_height)`

	This is where the real meat and taters is of our progress so far. This handles setting up our error struct, actually opening the image provided and reading the header data, pixel data, etc.

## Documenting Progress
Making progress

So far, I have created a function to read a JPEG. This initializes a struct (decompression struct) with jpeg_create_decompress. I have some basic error handling that will let you know if our code found the file you provided. Then I start the decompression process.	
Next we need to create a buffer and write the output of the decompression process to this buffer. 

I have made the full buffer by using:

    full_buffer = malloc(decomp.output_width * decomp.output_height *
	     decomp.output_components);

So we are allocating a section in memory with `malloc` that is the size of the width *times* the *height* times the *output components (3 = RGB)*. This buffer will store the entire RGB data of our image.
	
Also, we are creating an array of pointers to the rows of our image:

    JSAMPARRAY row_pointers = malloc(decomp.output_height *
	     sizeof(unsigned char *));

 We then use a for loop to allocate all the memory addresses (*pointers*) by doing some black-magic pointer arithmetic. This allows us to allocate our row pointers in the proper distance away from each other, in our test image's case would be 10080 bytes apart.
 The reason we have an array of row pointers is to have an easy way to point to every row in our image. Inside of our while loop, that utilizes jpeg_read_scanlines(), we provide a row of our buffer to read pixel data into (i.e. we provided `&row_pointers(i)`)

As briefly touched on in the previous note, we have a while loop that actually handles allocating the pixel data into our buffer. 

    int rows_read = jpeg_read_scanlines(&decomp, 
        &row_pointers[decomp.output_scanline], 1);

We have to realize that full_buffer is a POINTER to an ARRAY of bytes. 
`full_buffer[0]` will refer to our FIRST byte in our allocated buffer to store
a provided image.

So, in this context- know that full_buffer is an ADDRESS. the way pointer math works
is that when we add an int to an address, it will represent the address 'x' amount of 
bytes away from the original address. (where x = `(i * row_stride)`)
So we are practically saying hey, make this element in our row_pointers array to be the address of `full_buffer` `x` amount of bytes away.

We are reading our scanlines from the provided image into our buffer with our while loop.
This allows us to access RGB pixel data like so:

    printf("pixel 0: R%d G%d B%d\n", full_buffer[0], full_buffer[1],
		 full_buffer[2]);
    printf("pixel 3360: R%d G%d B%d\n", full_buffer[10078],
	     full_buffer[10079], full_buffer[10080]);

I know that it seems weird to access pixel data about pixel 3360 at `[10078]` but due to the nature of dealing with RGB data, each byte will represent Red, Green, Blue in the rows of our buffer. But we have to think of it as `row stride = 10080` since that is the LENGTH of each row. Our first row's rgb data will live in `[0]` through `[10080]`

But hey, NOW WE HAVE A BUFFER FULL OF PIXEL DATA!
What's next?
Now, we can start writing our resizing function. This function will take in a few things, like our `decomp` struct and our `full_buffer` that we will refer to as the `input_buffer` in the context of resizing.

Our resizing function will deal with things similarly to our read function, like setting up a `resize_buffer` (to store the RGB data about our new image) getting the row stride for this resize buffer, row pointers blah blah blah.. all that jazz

But the real FAT of the function will be in our meticulously crafted nested for loop- this for loop will handle setting our row pointers as the for loop in our `read_jpeg` function did, but this about the only similarity to that loop. 

In the outer loop, we will iterate on the amount of ROWS in our image. We have a nifty variable calculation for our `source_y` position that we will use to calculate our offset in the inner part of the loop.

Once we are in the inner loop, we will first calculate the `source_x` then our `offset`. In a comment I have:  Calculating offset values to map `input_buffer[rgb_value_index]` to its corresponding `resize_buffer[rgb_value_index]` and this describes it accurately. After that, we will calculate our `resize_offset` to tell the position to write pixel data to inside of our resize buffer.

Now, we are actually writing resized data inside of this new `resize_buffer` ðŸ˜Ž

It looks as such:

	  resize_buffer[resize_offset] = input_buffer[offset];
      resize_buffer[resize_offset + 1] = input_buffer[offset + 1];
      resize_buffer[resize_offset + 2] = input_buffer[offset + 2];

We are doing this for 3 positions each iteration because we have 3 RGB (1 red, 1 green, 1 blue) values per pixel. At the time of writing this, I am printing the first couple pixels full RGB value afterwards.

Now is time to give our new resize buffer over to our save_jpeg function. Now, we have achieved a resized image. But only in raw pixel data form. We are going to pass this data into our save_jpeg function that will handle writing the data into a `jpeg_compress_struct` much like we pass the source image into a `jpeg_decompress_struct`. We are initializing this struct, creating a new error managing struct for compression, and loading it up with the header data like `resize_height, resize_width` and the `input_components`. 

After some config telling our struct about our image, we use `jpeg_start_compress` and then implement a while loop to write our scanlines into our struct. Finally, we use `jpeg_finish_compress` to get our image!
